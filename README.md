Initial and intermediate data files can be found at dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jsxksn0hk.

Functions.R contains new functions developed for fitting large ordinal regression models using sparse matrices
01.Decompose.R contains the data preprocessing, model fits, and analysis of the effects
03.Network.R contains additional analysis of network properties for functional genotypes under different models
04.Simulation.R contains evolutionary simulations over different networks under different evolutionary conditions for each model
